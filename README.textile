h1. Destroy App Core

h2. Overview

Destroy App Core is a library for AIR application development.

h2. Hotkeys

h3. Creating a hotkey and adding it to the manager

<pre>
var hotkeyManager:HotkeyManager = new HotkeyManager(stage);

// manually instantiate a hotkey and add it to the manager with
var openHotkey:Hotkey = new Hotkey("command+o");
hotkeyManager.addHotkey(openHotkey);

// or use createHotkey to instantiate the hotkey 
// and automatically add it to the manager
var openHotkey:Hotkey = hotkeyManager.createHotkey("command+o");
</pre>

h3. Case-sensitivity

<pre>
// char-based hotkeys are case-sensitive, so
new Hotkey("command+f") != new Hotkey("command+F");
new Hotkey("command+F") == new Hotkey("command+shift+" + Keyboard.F);

// for modifier-specific hotkeys, use Keyboard keyCodes
new Hotkey("command+" + Keyboard.F);
new Hotkey("command+shift+" + Keyboard.F);
</pre>

h3. Special characters

<pre>
// char-based hotkeys can only have command and control modifiers, 
// so this throws an error
new Hotkey("alt+g");

// instead use
new Hotkey("alt+" + Keyboard.G);

// or if the intended hotkey is '©', use this since some
// keyboards are different and '©' is not alt+g
new Hotkey("©");
</pre>

h3. Numbers

<pre>
// don't use char-based hotkeys for numbers, like this
new Hotkey("command+2");

// instead use Keyboard keyCodes, since 2 is considered a keyCode
new Hotkey("command+" + Keyboard.NUMBER_2);
</pre>
